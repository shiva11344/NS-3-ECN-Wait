# SIM-06: Implementation of ECN+/Wait algorithm in ns-3 

## About project:
        ● Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a signaling mechanism used to inform the TCP 
          sender about congestion.
        ● Whereas ECN+ is a minor extension of ECN wherein SYN/ACK packets also carry the ECN marks.
        ● This project is a further extension of ECN+.This algorithm is described in RFC 5562. 
         This project intends to implement ECN+/Wait in ns-3.
